## OBJECTIVE OF THE COURSE

Automated object recognition - and more generally scene analysis - from photographs and videos is the great challenge of computer vision. The objective of this course is to provide a coherent introductory overview of the image, object and scene models, as well as the methods and algorithms, used today to address this challenge.

## Homeworks

* HW1: Instance-level recognition (SIFT)
